Requirements:

- scikitlearn
- seaborn
- NASA datasets

This project is an analysis of the current trajectory of Earth's increasing temperatures.
In this analysis we can see that the Earth's temperature is becoming too hot, thus showing
the statistical proof for Global warming.

In recent years the temperature change increase has become very rapid especially around 2019-2020
it has gone beyond the safe levels of increase shown by the linear regression line.
